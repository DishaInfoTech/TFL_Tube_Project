The duration of the exercise will be 60 minutes as below:
·  	5 minutes for the test requirement details.
·  	50 minutes for implementations
·  	5 minutes for the wrap!

What is the exercise?
For the exercise, we are choosing a free public API from TFL (Transport for London).
TFL is the integrated transport authority responsible for meeting the Mayor's strategy and commitments on transport in London.
TFL runs the day-to-day operation of the capital's public transport network and manages London's main roads. https://tfl.gov.uk/
TFL has different modes of transport and one of them is London Underground, better known as the Tube, has 11 lines covering 402km and serving 272 stations.
The Tube handles up to five million passenger journeys a day. At peak times, there are more than 543 trains whizzing around the capital.

As part of this exercise, we will use of TFL tube (London Underground) line APIs (https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/api-details#api=Line) to get & validate the status of the below train lines.

1.   Bakerloo
2.   Central
3.   Hammersmith & City
4.   Tram
5.   Waterloo & City

TFL releases the public TfL data (or 'open data') through APIs about its services
e.g.  https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/apis

Please design & implement BDD style scenario to validate that the service status of above mentioned 5 lines has “Good service”.

Step1: You would need to first use the API https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube and retrieve “id” from the response for the given line name.
This API would list all the lines for London Underground with details.
The implementation would include JSON response processing & fetching “id” for a given line name.

e.g Bakerloo line has id “bakerloo”

Step2: Using the “id” from the Step1, call status API https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/{id}/status
e.g https://api.tfl.gov.uk/Line/bakerloo/status
And validate lineStatuses.statusSeverityDescription is “Good service”.
